I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Psychology](https://psy.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes affective visualization, neuroscience, machine learning, and barrier-free design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianhui Wu](https://psy.szu.edu.cn/info/1101/1474.htm) of Stress Lab from [School of Psychology](https://psy.szu.edu.cn/) and [Prof. Zhida Sun](https://zhdsun.github.io/) of HCI Lab from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/). I am also very grateful for the help of [Prof. Jinting Liu](https://psy.szu.edu.cn/info/1019/1085.htm) of Positive Cognition Lab from [School of Psychology](https://psy.szu.edu.cn/), who is the guide to lead me on the academic road.

You can find my CV here: [Edward's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
